I received my B.Eng degree from Xidian University, China in 2010, and my Ph.D degree from City University of Hong Kong in 2015. After graduation, I stayed at City University of Hong Kong as a research fellow. I was a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University from September 2016 to June 2019, and is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University since July 2019.

My research interests include statistical signal processing, message passing algorithms, and optimization.
